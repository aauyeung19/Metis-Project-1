## Challenge
We are consulted to provide information for WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) on where to place street teams at subway stations. 
Their goal is to collect email address to share tickets for the gala. 
Our goal is to perform exploratory data analysis to provide insight based on the MTA Turnstile data sourced from their online data linked [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
